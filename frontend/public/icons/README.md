# App Icons for PWA

For a complete Progressive Web App implementation, you need to add the following icon files to this directory:

1. `favicon.ico` - 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixel versions combined in an .ico file
2. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixel PNG image
3. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixel PNG image

These icons will be used for:
- Browser tab favicon
- App icon when installed on home screen
- Splash screen when the app is launched
- App icon in app switchers

You can generate these icons from your app logo using tools like:

After generating the icons, place them in this directory.
